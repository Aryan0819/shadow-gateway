🛡️ Security Protocol Architecture
Temporal Security: Access is limited not just by identity, but by time, minimizing the attack surface significantly.

Zero-Trust: Every single request is validated against the real-time authorized IP stored in Firebase.

Ghosting: No "Forbidden" headers are sent. The server mimics a non-existent endpoint to prevent footprinting.

### Why this version stands out:

  * **Center Alignment:** The `<div>` tags make the header look much more like a professional landing page.
  * **Feature Cards:** The Markdown table for features creates a clean, 3-column "card" look.
  * **Interactive Feel:** Using Shields.io badges makes the repository look maintained and high-quality.

**Would you like me to help you create a specific "How it Works" section with a Mermaid.js diagram to show the IP-locking logic visually?**
